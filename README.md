## Introduction
A linked list is a data structure commonly used as an alternative to arrays when you need to dynamically add items without a specific size requirement.

## Overview
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how to implement a linked list data structure in C++. The program reads a file containing text, breaks it into lines, and then further breaks each line into words. Each line is represented by a linked list, where each word is stored in a node of the linked list. Finally, all the lines are stored in another linked list.

## Prerequisites
Before diving into the code, it is recommended to have the following knowledge:
- Basic understanding of C++ fundamentals.
- Familiarity with memory management and Pointers: Linked lists rely on dynamic memory allocation and pointer manipulation.
- Basic understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.
